"""The upstream Music Assistant facts this provider depends on, in one place.

Two suites assert against this one table:

* ``tests/python_integration/test_models_contract.py`` checks that the real
  ``music_assistant_models`` package still behaves this way.
* ``tests/python/test_stub_matches_contract.py`` checks that the hand-written
  stubs in ``tests/python/conftest.py`` behave the same way.

Pinning both ends to a single table is what closes the blind spot behind
issue #41. The unit suite runs entirely against stubs, so it can only ever be
as correct as they are: an earlier stub invented a ``ContentType.WEBM`` member,
and the whole suite passed green while real Music Assistant reported every
Opus stream as ``"?"``. Asserting the stub against the same table as the real
package makes that class of drift impossible in either direction.

This module is deliberately plain data with no imports. It is not collected as
a test (it does not match ``python_files``); both suites import it by path.
