"""Live smoke test: can we still resolve an audio stream anonymously today?

Deselected by default via the ``live`` marker in ``pytest.ini``, because it
reaches out to the real YouTube. The scheduled ``live-extraction`` workflow
re-selects it with ``-m live``.

No offline test can catch what this targets. Every other test feeds synthetic
format tables to the selector, so the whole suite stays green even if YouTube
stops serving usable formats to anonymous clients entirely. That is not a
hypothetical failure mode: it is exactly what happened to the ``android_music``
client this provider used to pin, and it surfaced only when a user reported it
(issue #41). Now that no client is pinned at all, the provider's behaviour is
inherited from yt-dlp's defaults, so an upstream change can silently alter what
users get without a single line of this repo changing.

This drives the real ``_get_stream_format``, so it exercises the production
``ydl_opts`` and the production selector string rather than a copy of them.

It also fetches bytes. Resolving a URL and playing it are separate failures:
issue #51 was a URL that resolved perfectly every time and then answered the
fetch with 403, because YouTube had put a pre-roll ad in front of the track.
This suite passed green every morning of that outage, because none of it ever
fetched anything. A canary that only checks extraction cannot see a playback
bug, so ``test_live_stream_url_is_fetchable_the_moment_it_is_handed_over``
fetches the first bytes of the URL the provider hands over, immediately, the
same way Music Assistant does.
